# R Programming Class Repository

Welcome to the R Programming Class Repository! This repository contains all the materials and code files used during my R programming classes. Each class focuses on specific topics to help you build a solid foundation in R programming and data analysis.

## Class 1: Arithmetic Operations

In this class, you'll dive into the world of R programming with a focus on fundamental arithmetic operations.
You will learn how to perform basic mathematical calculations, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
Additionally, you will be introduced to the concept of data types in R, exploring various data types like numeric, integer, character, and logical.
The topics covered are:

- Basic arithmetic operations
- Understanding and using different data types in R

## Class 2: Data Structures

Class 2 will introduce you to more complex data structures in R.
These data structures are essential for organizing and manipulating data effectively. The topics covered are:

- Arrays: Creating and manipulating multidimensional arrays.
- Dataframes: Working with dataframes for data manipulation and analysis.
- Lists: Understanding versatile data structures that can hold different types of objects.
- Matrices: Exploring two-dimensional arrays for mathematical operations.

## Class 3: Conditional Programming and Logical Operations

Conditional programming is crucial for decision-making in R. In this class, you will learn how to execute code based on specific conditions.
The topics covered are:

- Conditional statements (if, else, else if)
- Logical operators (AND, OR, NOT)
- Relational operators (>, <, ==, !=)
- Ternary operator (ifelse())
- Determining parity of numbers

## Class 4: Functions and Loops

In Class 4, you will explore functions and loops, essential tools for efficient programming in R. The topics covered are:

- Functions: Creating and using functions to organize and reuse code.
- Recursive Functions: Understanding functions that call themselves.
- While Loop: Executing code repeatedly while a condition is true.

## Class 5: Data Visualization and Basic Statistics

Data visualization and basic statistics are critical for understanding and presenting data effectively. In this class, you will learn:

- Data Visualization: Creating various types of graphs and visualizations in R.
- Basic Statistics: Introduction to statistical analysis and calculations in R.
