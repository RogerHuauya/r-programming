Create an vector of 1000 in size in which you simulate dice outcomes

```{r}
#TODO

```

Plot the probability distribution of the simlation vector you have generated.

```{r}
#TODO

```

Generate 100000 points using a gaussian distribution with mean 25 and standard deviation 2

```{r}
#TODO

```

Write two estimators: the first one should take 10 samples and get the average of them, then you should replicate this 30000 times; the second one should take 30 samples instead.

```{r}
#TODO

```

Plot each estimators PDF (probabilistic density distribution) and conclude which one is the best estimator.
